### Overview:
This project applies machine learning techniques to football analytics, aiming to modernize the scouting process. By analyzing the 2024-2025 season data, we move beyond basic statistics (like Goals and Assists) to understand player profiles, playing styles, and performance efficiency. The goal is to build an automated system that can identify suitable replacement players and spot undervalued talent in the transfer market.
