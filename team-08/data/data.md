# Data

Within the code we submitted, our code reads straight from the the dataset into a data structure. Because we already had a rebust way to retrive the data, we decided to leave the data fetching in the ipynb file.

Under the "Dataset Options" Cell, you have the ability to choose one of the several data sets we have used to test the models. Simply change the number chosen in `set_data()`, and the data that the rest of the code will use will be properly loaded.

If the above directions are followed, then the later testing code will automatically run our implementation and the pytorch implementation on the same data.
