# TEAM 1: Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption

Team ID: 1

Members: Anushka Arun

Overview: Being able to detect anomalies in energy consumption can save costs and help ensure more sustainable practices. This project aimed to test two unsupervised anomaly detection methods as well as a one semi-supervised method for comparison on anomalies energy readings provided by ASHRAE. Different hybrid models that were tested includes: LSTM autoencoder and OC-SVM, LSTM autoencoder and KNN, LSTM autoencoder and DBSCAN. 

Usage: Download the python notebook and open in Google Collab. Save data and change file location accordingly. Click run all at the top of the screen. 

Data: Can be downloaded from data folder and file, but also can be retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/energy-anomaly-detection/data
