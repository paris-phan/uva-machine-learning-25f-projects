# Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation on MRI

## Team info
Team ID: 26

Members: Jonathan Varghese

## Overview
This project trains a 2D U-Net to segment tumors into the following subregions:

* Necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET)
* Peritumoral edema (ED)
* GD-enhancing tumor (ET)

It does this by labeling pixels as one of the above (including background).
