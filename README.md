## Overview
In this repository, we prepare everything that is needed to reproduce our results for the final project of CS4774 machine learning. In this project, we try to classify mushrooms into edible or poisonous with a focus on less false edible. Our goal is to build models that could predict the class of the mushrooms with 75% recall or above. To achieve that goal, we collected multiple datasets and train baseline CNN model and MobileNet model.

## Usage:
To run our code and get the results, make sure that you changed the directory of the dataprocessing.ipynb to your working directory. After processing the code, run other scripts to build models and see results.

## Setup:
The setup needed for this project can be done follow:

step 1: Install python of version 3.9-3.11. Run python --version to see if the version is proper.

step 2: Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
